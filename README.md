# Spotify-Database-Management-408-Final

This project includes the MySQL Database, the ReactJS Frontend, and the ExpressJS server to allow the frontend and backend to communicate. 
This project needs NodeJS installed with the NPM.
In order to run:

1. Create a database in MySQL and name it Spotify.
2. Run all of the scripts in the SQL Spotify Server to create the database
3. Open a terminal and navigate to Express-Server and enter 'npm rebuild' in terminal to install dependencies
4. After installing dependencies, use 'node index.js' to run the expressJs server. 
5. Do the same as Number 3 in the database-final folder to install the dependencies for the front-end
6. Use 'npm start' to start the ReactJS frontend

Thank you for the great semester!
